COA TASKFORCE Take Home 

my repository contains my submission for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. 
The challenge includes building an interactive photo gallery and solving two coding challenges using JavaScript.

Interactive Photo Gallery
more instructions:

Clone the repository to your  machine:

git clone< https://github.com/rugemana/christian_interactive_photo_gallery/tree/main

Navigate to the project directory:
 interactive-photo-gallery
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery.
open the index.js file to see the interactive gallery structure, location and all
Approach
HTML Structure: I used  the provided Figma designs to create the HTML structure for the photo gallery Each image  is wrapped in a <div> element with appropriate classes for styling and interaction.

CSS Styling: I used CSS to style the gallery elements, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy with the Figma designs Media queries were implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and mobile devices

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript was used to implement interactivity features such as image  navigation and hover interactions, Additional details are displayed when a user hovers over a photo, as specified in the Figma prototype.

 ui Challenge contains:
 index.html and index.js.

coding Challenges
you Open the arrayMap.js and stringTransform.js files in your preferred code editor to view the solutions,
Approach
Array Manipulation (arrayMap.js): I implemented a function to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to the target The solution follows the provided problem statement and constraints, achieving the expected time and space complexity

String Transformation (stringTransform.js): I set a function to transform a string based on the provided rules. The solution handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem statement and achieves the expected time and space complexity.
